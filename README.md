# Peach repository


The purpose of this repository is to store in one place all my pet projects and leaning tasks that I do.

Since most of this stuff will be for learning purposes, don't expect it to be very elegant or to even work.


If you're wondering why I named this repository "Peach", it's a reference to my last name in my native language, and how most of my friends refer to me
